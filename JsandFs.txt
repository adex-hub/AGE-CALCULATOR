This was within the superUpdate() FUNCTION in the JS folder ↓
  // yobField.value?console.log(yobField.value):console.log('nope');
  // console.log(regex.test(yobField.value));

...while I was testing it.
  

This was in the main JS file and I made this code a while ago for a reset feature which later seemed useless.

/*INITIALIZATION FUNCTION*/
// document.querySelector(".reset").addEventListener("click", init());
// function init() {
//   document.querySelector("#dob").value = "";
//   document.querySelector(".yob").value = "";
//   document.querySelector(".selected").id = 13;
//   document.querySelector(".info-tab").style.display = "none";
// }
//dayOfBirth > currDay ? dayOfBirth - currDay : currDay - dayOfBirth;
//const birthMonth = Math.abs(theMonth - mainMonth);
//else if (dayOfBirth === currDay) {
//dob = 0;

My joys and Failures 😆😂 (How I felt towards the end of coding this project)
    This is stressing me out for real.

     Yay! it finally worked 😁🎉😊
        -Me, 21/11/22 - When I finally completed this project.

A Few console.logs that I used during its development that I couldn't let go 😂😂.

  console.log(lastday(currYear, mainMonth));
  console.log(birthMonth);
  console.log(document.querySelector(".selected"));

STORY BEHIND THIS PROJECT!
    I started this project last year [2021] while I was learning JavaScript and I stumbled on JavaScript's getDate feature. I was so fascinated by it,
    that I was moved to build this age calculator. I completed it June 2021. Then this year, I revisited this project to give it some added features and
    fix some bugs that I couldn't fix at the time. And now I am glad about where this project is at, at the moment because I was able to do everything
    I set out to accomplish on this project.

    To eveyone who needs to build something, get started and build that thing, do what you need to do. When you fix a bug 
    you considered difficult or you successfully complete the project you started off building, you become more confident in your
    abilities as a developer and you also learn along the way too. You also get the confidence to try building more cool projects 😎.
    And it would ensure you have enough projects to show off in the long run. So get to work and explore possibilities.
